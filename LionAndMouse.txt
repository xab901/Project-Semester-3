The Lion and the Mouse
A lion, resting in the forest, woke to the tiny scuttling of a mouse running across his nose. The
lion, roused from his nap, angrily grabbed the mouse, intending to crush it. The mouse begged
for its life, promising to repay the lion's kindness one day. The amused lion, though skeptical,
spared the mouse.
