The Lion and the Mouse
A lion, resting in the forest, woke to the tiny scuttling of a mouse running across his nose. The
lion, roused from his nap, angrily grabbed the mouse, intending to crush it. The mouse begged
for its life, promising to repay the lion's kindness one day. The amused lion, though skeptical,
spared the mouse. Later, the lion was caught in a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he roared for help. The
mouse, hearing his distress, remembered the lion's kindness. Running to the net, she gnawed
through the ropes, freeing the lion. The lion was amazed that the small mouse could help him
and the mouse reminded him that even the smallest can make a difference.
